## Implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms

### Algorithms included:

#### Temporal-Difference (TD) learning algorithms: Q-learning, Sarsa

#### n-steps Boostrapping: n-steps Sarsa

#### Linear function approximation: Semi-gradient Sarsa with tile encoding

#### Deep Reinforcement Learning: DQN

##### All algorithms are tested with [MountainCar-v0](https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/MountainCar-v0) environment in experiments/. Use plot_learning.py to plot the results.
